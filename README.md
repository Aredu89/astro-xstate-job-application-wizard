# Multi-step Job Application

This is a multi-step job application form built with Astro, Solid.js, and XState.
It guides users through entering personal info, experience, portfolio links, and uploading a resume, with validation at each step.
The state machine handles the form flow and transitions, while the file upload step is delegated to a child machine for isolated validation logic.
